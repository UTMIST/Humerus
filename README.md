TODO: everyone write something like the following...

## What it does

## How it works

## Overview
- Architecture (front/backend)
- model design choices: considering deployment, cost, runtime, etc

## Challenges
- What makes the problem unique, etc

## What we learned

## What's next 
- benchmark model... 

## What didn't work
- Discussing other approaches and why they did/did not work
- Talk about GPT-2 approach
        - this would've been a good way to get humor in but is not feasible for deployment
