So, without further ado - here are the winners for each category:###Most Thought Provoking Submission- 1st Place: [Maybe 'Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?' isn't a show that displays how stupid grown adults can be, but rather, a show that depicts how much useless information we teach grade schoolers that won't be retained or applicable later in life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/218trj/maybe_are_you_smarter_than_a_5th_grader_isnt_a/)- 2nd place: [Instead of looking up into the sky, you're actually gazing down into the infinite cosmic abyss, with only gravity holding you to the surface of the Earth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2p9l60/instead_of_looking_up_into_the_sky_youre_actually/)###Best Idea- 1st: [If you would mount garbage trucks with camera's you could weekly update google maps street view.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2hm8se/if_you_would_mount_garbage_trucks_with_cameras/)- 2nd: [If a million of us picked a certain redditor and all donated just $1, we would have the power to make someone a millionaire.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2mq94c/if_a_million_of_us_picked_a_certain_redditor_and/)###Funniest Submission- 1st: [what are snails even trying to do](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/22rzxj/what_are_snails_even_trying_to_do/)- 2nd: [Guys get erections every morning, right? The concept of ""morning"" varies depending on where you live, with the ""morning line"" basically spinning around the earth infinitely, right? So does that mean that humanity has been doing a ""boner wave"" around the earth for hundreds of thousands of years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2aokbz/)###Most Depressing but Insightful Submission- 1st: [Essentially, the heart beats itself to death.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2q7kwd/essentially_the_heart_beats_itself_to_death/)- 2nd: [Your shadow is a confirmation that light has traveled nearly 93 million miles unobstructed, only to be deprived of reaching the ground in the final few feet thanks to you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2is9jp/your_shadow_is_a_confirmation_that_light_has/)###Most Underrated Submission- 1st: [Are hands just naked sock puppets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2q3edb/are_hands_just_naked_sock_puppets/)- 2nd: So, you might have noticed the Most Underrated Submission's 2nd place field is blank. There were so few nominees, and most of them were unoriginal, reposts, or simply didn't have any votes. So instead of just picking one of those, I've decided to use this final slot in a rather selfish way... by awarding my favorite (and apparently overlooked) post of the year:- [As a dishwasher, I come home after hours of work in which I get covered in filth, and I take a shower only to realize...I am the final dish.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/21xwvo/as_a_dishwasher_i_come_home_after_hours_of_work/)Congratulations to all the winners! Thank you to everyone who voted and submitted nominations, and thanks again to all you subscribers who help make this subreddit so great!-----A few reminders:- [**Follow us on twitter**](https://twitter.com/rShowerThoughts) (if you're into that sort of thing). Every day we share some of our favorite posts, making an effort to find posts that might not have gotten the most attention here on the subreddit.- Please report unoriginal posts and reposts - this is the best way to help us keep the subreddit as fresh and enjoyable as possible!",321

If someone else could test that would be great.  Please use this at your own risk since I am not familiar with chrome web app extensions.  * Several uses have pointed out that Windows Phone has this capability.

Finding a gender stereotype funny does not equal misogyny.

You should be able to downvote google links that were completely worthless or spammy,"The most common example I can think of is when I google something like ""best anrdoid apps for telling the weather"" and I get a million hits from articles that are just copied and pasted from each other.Edit: An example of where this would be useful is something that google can't objectively decide on. For example if I type in ""Greg's Plumbing in Liverpool, England"" there will most likely be only one website that should rightfully reach the top result in that situation. On the other hand if I type in something like ""Cool PC Games"" google has no way of knowing which games people like or don't. Instead the websites which inevitably get to the top are articles which use SEO. Search engine optomization is when people use specific keywords which are designed to make google like that article over articles that don't use SEO. Countless hundreds of website make short four or five paragraph articles like this to generate ad revenue. The articles have very little real value, and you have to go through alot of them to find anything meaningful. Voting would ensure that only the best most insightful and well written ones ended up in the top.Edit 2: If this guy is correct, google has already solved this with their bounce feature: https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/322b4o/you_should_be_able_to_downvote_google_links_that/cq7imz1",1379

I didn't expect this many responses, but i would like to say i am fully aware that a higher power can be anything of one's choosing. My father was an alcoholic for most of my life, and AA failed to help him multiple times. He is now doing great and is almost 2 years sober. Coming from a home in wich everyone except me went through beating addictions/ going through rehab, i understand the process of recovery very well. I had this shower thought, which i thought was amusing enough to share with my fellow redditors. There are many AA meetings that center around the christian faith, but i am fully aware this may not be the majority. To anyone battling addiction, i hope, with all my heart, that you recover by any means you find works for you. And if you're finally living the sober life than keep up the good work!  ",1555

Charities and various other cool things people on reddit do could win. Also, even gaining 10,000 followers on instagram or twitter is a significant increase.EDIT: So here's my thoughts on guidelines. If this goes forward, I will let the people help decide how it works.1. Entry accounts must be at least 1 day old (created before the post).2. Once a month we pick a winner randomly (TBD how), they link all of the social media accounts they want (individuals pick which ones they want to follow).3. We create social media accounts accessible by moderators of the contest sub for anyone to follow as well. 4. The posts those accounts will make will be to announce that month's winner (this should help solve the !Remindme problems with the millionaire one) and promote following the winner.5. Incentivize following somehow. Maybe we use social media monitoring tools to see if the person actually followed last month's winner. People that follow more winners, have a higher chance to win (1 submission = 2 chances, etc).EDIT2: A neat idea from /u/HD_ERR0R could be to also pick a random social media profile for everyone to randomly follow. Imagine receiving 5,000 followers and people tweeting how awesome and famous you are without even participating in the contest. This could be fun to do inbetween official rounds.",887

"You are not ""raising a child"" you are ""training a future adult""","People need to understand that the sole job of being a parent isn't just to protect their kid. It's also to train your kid to NOT grow up to be an asshole. If you do everything for them while they're kids, they will never learn to be part of our society. Letting a kid do something like interact with another child and possibly get a little mad at each other, teaches them to work things out themselves, make up, and ultimately just how to deal with life. Our children are too coddled. EDIT - What I was really getting at is - If you raise a child, people keep the kid [as they are now] as the main focus. Too many parents fail to keep the adult they will become as a high priority.Example - Letting a child play in the backyard with themselves for a little while, encourages a sense of self, [imagination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTn7xtVsE6U), and learning how to figure out whatever it is they're doing on their own. Though if you go out there every single time and play with them and DON'T give them any of that time, they end up NEEDING to have someone next to them. They don't figure things out easily on their own, and they can become co-dependent.  ",1775

"A really good, lucid dream is your brain telling itself a story that it's making up as it goes.","So last night I had one of those rare dreams that felt like I was watching a movie. It wasn't just random dream shit, it had a full storyline with a start, an ending, and twists throughout. I woke up actually amazed at how entertaining this dream was. Then it occurred to me. My brain made that whole story up as it went along without any planning and actually surprised, enthralled and entertained itself in the process. It's like it split itself in two, half being the story teller, the other half being the audience, and then proceeded to make up a brilliant story on the fly that was so good that I woke up and wanted to watch it again. I mean that's fucked up. How amazing is the brain to be able to do that? EDIT: The more I think about this, the more mind = blown I get. What about nightmares? Your brain tells itself a story that genuinely scares itself? Like how does it a) come up with such horrifying shit, and b) hide the storyline from itself to the point where it can even be scared of what it just made?Try and tell yourself a scary story while awake and firstly, it will be a shit story, and secondly, there's no way you could terrorise yourself from it.

When that 5 million could buy 74,671,445 bottles of water and they could tell me how to brush my teeth on their box.","""Did that go the way you thought it would go?"" Will FerrellJust a couple things: For those of you who think I really want Colgate to purchase that amount of bottled water, you're missing my point. Just like your missing the point of a shower thought. Secondly I take hot showers, who doesn't do math on the steam covered door. Don't tell me saving my water gives water to the needy. It doesn't. I pay for my water. The percentage of water used by homes in comparison to companies could only be found with a microscope. (Also the price of the water that I used for the breakdown was used by the store price by my house for 28 bottles) Don't tell me it wasn't about the needy. It was, they had a girl with dirt on her face sipping water. Finally, I understand the idea of the commercial was for Colgate to come across as caring. But just imagine what they could have done with the $5 million they spent on the SB commercial. I don't know about you, but I feel safe in saying that most people buy toothpaste based on one of two things. Preference(price, taste, etc) or dentist recommended. With that being said, it's not something you just go into a store and say, I really want to try this new/different toothpaste. So a 5 million dollar commercial for Colgate based on water usage is pointless in the big picture when you look at their usage compared to the average consumer running water. TLDR:  I don't let my water run. I do math on the door with hot showers, they use way more water than us. 5 million dollars wasted.

If I say ""call X"" it will dial from my watch and I can talk to that person as if the watch is on loudspeaker. There should be an emergency one used in extreme cases: like being kidnapped. It should call the police force, and  be a one way audio connection so that the attackers can't hear what's going on but the police can.  But if you then pick up the call on your iPhone you can talk to the police if you are able to. Also, it should be able to find your location via GPS regardless of what your data plan is on your phone.This can obviously be done with other smart watches.

Showerthoughts Charity 2016: Step 1,"Hey everyone! Some of you might remember our [2014 charity: water campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2a9dve/rshowerthoughts_charity_water_campaign/) where, with your help, we raised [just over $10,000!](https://my.charitywater.org/drumcowski/rshowerthoughts-charity-water-2014-1) That was enough to fully fund an *entire* project, as well as partially fund one other. Our fully funded project, a drilled well in Malawi, [provided clean drinking water for 243 people](https://mycw.charitywater.org/p/myprojectsview?project_id=MW.WVI.Q3.14.169.024&amp;campaign_id=55319) who previously had to walk 2 hours to collect *unclean* drinking water. [The second project we helped fund](https://mycw.charitywater.org/p/myprojectsview?project_id=MW.WVI.Q3.14.169.245&amp;campaign_id=55319), a well at a Malawian school, gave 415 children clean drinking water, hygiene training, and a hand washing station. As these projects were only just completed this past March, I felt now was an appropriate time to re-thank all that donated and spread the word of our campaign, as well as to the reddit admins at the time that supported our cause by giving us generous amounts of free advertising on this site (special shoutout to /u/hueypriest!). You helped improve the lives of **658 people**.-----##2016 CampaignSince the end of our previous campaign, I've wanted to put together another campaign. I failed to do so last year, something I still regret, but am eager to rectify this year. Instead of just doing another simple 'donate page' campaign like we did in 2014, we would like to do things slightly differently this year by offering Logo T-Shirts (and maybe some other items) for sale, with all proceeds going towards our campaign. The problem is, we don't have experience with getting shirts/stickers/etc. made. That's where you guys come in:We're hoping some of you reading this post might know of a quality T-Shirt company, large or small, that might be interested in partnering up with us for this campaign. 2 small caveats: - Must be able to print onto shirts that closely match our blue banner color (and perhaps our red).- Must also offer ""Tall"" sizes (even if in limited amounts). If you have anybody in mind, please send more information to us at rshowerthoughts@gmail.com or send me a PM directly. *Not a fan of shirts but still might want to donate?* No worries, we'll still have a campaign page you can donate to.We're still (clearly) very much in the early stages of planning this. We'll likely have a few more posts in the near future once we've found a vendor to partner with, where we'll likely get your input on design/colors/etc. Until then, if you have any comments/questions please feel free to leave them below.

So this wouldn't mean we have a longer year, the seasons wouldn't change relative to the calendar and life expectancy wouldn't dropC) TIL many Americans seem to be paid on a weekly or fortnightly basis (not ALL, just a fair few), for them it would mean an additional monthly rent bill, but no increase in the amount they are paid.

Fair enough: Stephen Curry's annual salary is $11MM. My annual salary is $90k. So a $25,000 fine to curry is like a $205 fine to me. Definitely hurts more but is still not astronomical.EDIT 2: Okay, everyone has been telling me to ""get my shit together"" because I make $90k and my net worth is ONLY $5k. Let me explain to you personal finance gurus: I have $100k in student loan debt from undergrad and graduate degrees. I'm married with three kids and just turned age 30. I don't own a home, so I do not have equity to account for in my net worth. Also, I live in Southern California and pay $2,500 for rent.

"Dating in your 30s and 40s is like, ""I wonder what this person's tragedy is""","Since this has blown up I want to add my $1.05.First off, I'm a guy (I'm looking at you, creepy-PM sender).I wrote this in the spirit of play.  I'm 33 and spent most of the past decade incinerating my own baggage.  A 60-something gentleman told me once that as long as a person continues to grow, each decade is better than the previous.  And in my more limited experience, that is true.  It's a good life and I have high hopes for it being a better one.The dating world isn't like college anymore though.  Everybody has experience.  In an inescapable way the dating experience is less fresh than it was as a kid.  We know most of our likes and dislikes already.  There are fewer surprises.But I think going into it with increased wisdom is a good thing, and the fact that 20-something me didn't get hitched makes me thank that little punk for his bullet-dodging agility.  Besides, there are still those ""childlike"" moments where you experience a raw aspect of love you missed out on as a neurotic youth.  I dated a woman when I was 30 that was the freshest experience of my entire love life to date.This was a lighthearted shower thought intended to poke fun of the fact that everybody has a story.  I wasn't trying to start a philosophical discussion.  I figured it would get a few ups or downs, one or two snarky comments, and go the way of most Reddit posts.And it absolutely was not intended to be tidings of doom for the aging.  (Or ""aging"".  I'm 33.  40-somethings whom I included in my title, feel free to call me out on my bullshit.)If you're aging and you don't feel like you're growing as I mentioned above, I recommend seeking therapy.  That's how I started growing.  (In my experience with good and bad therapists, look for the trifecta of 1. older, 2. same-sex, and 3. at least as smart as you.  PM me if you want to discuss this further). I agree with the commenters here who shared that dating has gotten more fun for them as they've gotten older.  That has been my experience too.  You learn that dating is recreation, and you learn not to waste time on situations that aren't working out for you.  You're less controlled by guilt.  You're freer.Have fun out there, y'all.  Happy aging.  We're all gonna die someday, but the farther you go the deeper the types of happiness available to you, so don't give up on life.  Live long and prosper.SECOND EDIT: For the ""wizards"" out there, I didn't mean for my first edit to be disheartening.  I'm sorry it came across that way for some of you.  I just wanted to add that a lot of the baggage I mentioned incinerating surrounds the feeling of being immature in the sense of having a lot less experience than my peers.  I didn't start dating a lot until 28-29-ish, and even then there was this sick, nagging feeling of playing ""catch up"".  A feeling that I've missed out on an important aspect of being human (the fun, sex-positive college years a lot of people reminisce about) and I can never, ever retrieve it.  It's awful.  It made me sick to the core of my soul.  It's a valid human experience.  Please don't lose hope.  Remember what I said about growing.  I'm convinced that is where the secret is.  Identify the areas where you feel you are lacking and put your effort there (that might mean making sex a genuine *priority*).  Therapy was a game-changer for me.  Get some if you're feeling hopeless.  (The book *Neurosis and Human Growth* was also a game-changer for me.  Thought I'd go ahead and plug it.)  The road is a hard one but making progress on it is worth it.  I promise you it is.  Don't give up.",6264

Under physical pain we fight to survive. Under mental pain we long for death.,"EDIT: I've seen some people remark that the type of pain may not matter. I agree that we don't become suicidal after a little mental pain (a bad day at work) and that enough physical pain can make us long for death as well. However, I still stand by my statement that the type of pain matters. This is because the source of mental anguish may lie in the nature of the individual's daily life, whereas physical pain arises from a disruption of this normalcy (in the form of that pain). For this reason, and from my experience with both types of pain, I stand by my statement.What's important to remember here I think is that mental pain is not equated to unending physical torture. I would rather equate it to seizures, or random paralyzing spasms of pain in one's leg. These types of physical pain are crippling, yet something we fight through, while the same form of mental pain (anxiety attacks, bouts of depression) may lead us to contemplate suicide. Yes, both constant anxiety and constant physical torture would both lead us to desire death. But that's not the point of this shower thought, in my opinion.

"For a non-native speaker, making a pun demonstrates the highest understanding of language. As a native speaker, making a pun demonstrates the lowest understanding of comedy.","Edit: A lot of people seem to be misinterpreting what I meant in the second half of this post.1.A low understanding does not mean it isn't comedy. It's just proving you have a grasp of the lowest level. For example: the lowest level of understanding Spanish you could say something like ""Hola, come estas?"" While you could be fluent in Spanish, all this demonstrates on it's own is an understanding at the lowest level.2.Everyone that is saying something else is the lowest level, it's a level, there is room for all other types of low-level comedy like slapstick or dirty jokes. The point is on this low level it doesn't involve much thought.  A pun is just a step above rhyming (in my opinion). It's basic word association. Everyone likes it because basically everyone can do it (in their native language). This is why you don't see stand up comedians (at least any good ones) going up and spouting off puns as their entire act, you can work them in as it is a comedic tool, but it is not the be-all and end-all.",37079
